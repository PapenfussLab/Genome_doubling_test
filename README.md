Whole Genome Doubling . TEST

By modelling copy number evolution in cancer using a pair of branching processes, one modeling aneuploidy only and the other also including a single Whole Genome Doubling (WGD) event, we can infer whether or not genome doubling occurred. We can also label each event as being pre or post GD.
